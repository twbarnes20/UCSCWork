This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Kevin Cai (kcai2@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Trevor Barnes (trwbarne@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Kevin Cai spent           4    hours working alone.
Trevor Barnes spent       4    hours working alone.
We spent              8   hours working together.
Trevor Barnes spent   4    hours driving.
Kevin Cai spent       4    hours driving.
